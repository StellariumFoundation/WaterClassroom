## 2 · Market Opportunity & Problem Statement  
| Metric | Data Point | Source |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Global EdTech spend | \$404 B (2021) → projected \$605 B by 2027 | HolonIQ |
| AI-in-Education CAGR | **45 %** (2023-2030) | Statista 2025 |
| Adaptive-Learning market size | \$5.3 B by 2025 | eLearning Industry |
| Student AI adoption | 86 % already use AI tools weekly | ScrumLaunch 2025 |

**Pain points**  
1. *One-size-fits-all instruction* → disengagement & uneven outcomes.  
2. *Teacher overload* grading/admin; little time for mentorship.  
3. *Fragmented tooling* (LMS, content, games, analytics) with poor interoperability.  
4. *Access & equity* barriers for rural, low-income or home-schooled learners.

Water Classroom addresses these gaps with a single, scalable, AI-first solution.
