# Water Classroom Metaverse Vision  
**Document:** `docs/METAVERSE_VISION.md`  
**Version:** 1.0 · June 2025

## 1 · Why Immersive 3D? — The Pedagogical North Star  
Traditional 2-D e-learning limits cognition to sight and sound.  
Immersive 3-D adds ✔ embodied cognition, ✔ situated context and ✔ kinaesthetic memory, increasing retention by up to **30 %** (Stanford VHIL, 2024). Water Classroom’s metaverse will **let students *live* the lesson**, turning abstract ideas into spatial experiences.

## 2 · System Architecture for the Metaverse Layer  

| Tier | Tech | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Client** | Unity WebGL build · WebXR · Mobile ARCore/ARKit · OpenXR for headsets | Render 3-D scenes in browser, phone or headset |
| **Edge** | CDN + CloudFront WebSocket acceleration | Low-latency asset delivery & real-time sync |
| **Metaverse Backend** | Photon Fusion (Unity) + Water Realtime-hub svc (Go, Redis) | Multiplayer state, matchmaking, voice proximity chat |
| **Content API** | `metaverse-svc` micro-service (gRPC) | Scene manifests, physics parameters, asset URLs |
| **Simulation Engine** | Unity Data-Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS) | Deterministic physics, ECS scalability |
| **Storage** | S3 (glTF, textures), IPFS pinning for NFT assets | Versioned assets & on-chain provenance |
| **Credential Layer** | Polygon smart contracts · Blockcerts | Mint proof-of-experience NFTs after lab completion |

## 3 · Virtual World Design & Learning Spaces  

| Space | Description | Learning Objective Example |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **STEM Ocean Lab** | Underwater base with manipulative fluid tanks | Density, buoyancy, Archimedes’ principle |
| **History Hub** | Time-travelling plaza with era portals | Walk 1969 Moon landing or Medieval markets |
| **Literature Theatre** | Interactive stage where plays unfold | Act scenes from *Hamlet* with AI NPCs |
| **Math Arena** | Floating islands; geometry puzzles as physical structures | Derive Pythagoras by measuring bridge spans |

All spaces follow **“read-do-reflect”** loop: exposition plaques ➜ hands-on task ➜ AI avatar debrief.

---

## 4 · Physics-Based Simulations & Interactive Labs  
• **Custom DOTS physics modules** for fluids, electromagnetism, optics.  
• **Real-time instrumentation HUD** (graphs, vector arrows).  
• **Assessment hooks** emit telemetry → `assessment-svc` auto-grades lab performance.

Example: *ChemBond Lab* — students drag atoms, real-time valence checking prevents impossible molecules; correct compound mints “Molecular Mastery” NFT.

## 5 · Cross-Platform Accessibility  
| Device | Mode | Target FPS |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Chrome/Safari desktop | WebGL 2.0 | 60 fps |
| iOS / Android | Unity URP + AR Foundation | 45 fps |
| Quest 3 / Pico Neo | OpenXR | 72 fps |
Graceful degradation: low-poly LODs, baked lighting, optional 2-D fallback video.

## 6 · Social & Collaborative Learning Features  
1. **Knowledge Raids** – 4-6 learners solve multi-step quests (p2p voice, shared tools).  
2. **Proximity Voice & Emoji Gestures** – fosters presence while preventing global noise.  
3. **AI Moderation** – toxicity filter + auto-mute.  
4. **Shared Whiteboards & 3-D Annotations** – export snapshot to PDF in LMS.  
5. **Global Tournaments** – leaderboard, e-sports style math challenges streamed to web.

---

## 7 · Educator Content-Creation Toolkit  
*Unity-based “**Quest Builder**”* plugin:  
- Drag-and-drop lesson prefab, set learning goals & rubrics.  
- No-code logic blocks (if-solve → open door).  
- One-click publish → IPFS + `metaverse-svc` manifest.  
- Revenue split smart contract auto-mints royalty NFT (70 % creator).  

Roadmap: web-only mini-scene builder using Three.js + glb uploads.

---

## 8 · Performance & Scalability  
- **ECS & DOTS**: 50+ concurrent avatars / scene at <10 ms server tick.  
- **GPU Instancing** for repeating meshes; texture atlasing halves draw calls.  
- **Dynamic Netcode**: authority hand-off, delta compression, 30 kbps per user.  
- **Cloud Autoscale**: K8s HPA on CPU + WS P95 latency; Region-based shards.

## 9 · Implementation Roadmap  

| Quarter | Milestone | Key Deliverables |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Q3-25** | Metaverse MVP | Ocean Lab, Realtime-hub v1, 20 CCU test |
| **Q4-25** | Multi-Device Beta | Mobile AR support, crossplay sync, avatar chat |
| **Q1-26** | Physics Labs GA | Optics & Chemistry DOTS modules, assessment hooks |
| **Q2-26** | Creator Studio Alpha | Unity Quest Builder, on-chain royalties |
| **Q3-26** | Blockchain Credentials | Experience NFTs, soul-bound skill graph |
| **Q4-26** | Global Tournament Launch | Math Arena PvP, spectator mode, Twitch API |

## 10 · Learning Effectiveness & Research Agenda  
*Partners:* Stanford VHIL, ETH Zürich ICVR, UNICEF Learning Lab.  

| Study | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Immersive vs 2-D | Concept retention after 4 wks | **+25 %** |
| VR Lab vs physical | Cost per learner per experiment | **-60 %** |
| Social presence | Self-reported engagement (Likert) | **>4.3/5** |
| Motion sickness | SSQ score | ≤ Mild (mean < 15) |

Data captured (ClickHouse) will power iterative design & publish peer-reviewed papers, reinforcing Water Classroom’s academic credibility.

**Conclusion**  
Water Classroom’s metaverse layer will fuse **cutting-edge 3-D tech, rigorous pedagogy and decentralised ownership** to create the world’s most engaging, equitable and future-proof learning ecosystem. By 2026, millions of learners will not just watch lessons—**they will *live* them**.
