	// For Stripe, we can use the mock server provided by stripe-go (`testutil.NewTestServer`)
	// or actual Stripe test mode keys (if network calls are acceptable for these tests).

	// Let's assume `app.SetupRouter` initializes everything including payment service and routes.
	// The payment service would need to be configured to use the Stripe test server if we go that route.
	// This usually means setting stripe.DefaultBackend via stripe.SetBackend before client init.

	// For now, we'll initialize the router.
	// The actual app setup might be more involved (DB, other services).
	// testRouter = app.SetupRouter(cfg, nil /* db */, nil /* other services */)
	// This is a placeholder; actual app setup will be specific to the project structure.
	// For payment tests, we need to ensure the payment service is initialized.

	// If using Stripe test server:
	// stripeTestServer := testutil.NewTestServer()
	// stripe.DefaultBackend = stripe.GetBackendWithConfig(stripe.APIBackend, &stripe.BackendConfig{
	// 	URL: stripeTestServer.URL,
	// })
	// Now, when payment.NewPaymentService initializes its Stripe client, it will use this test server.

	// For this example, we'll assume SetupRouter correctly sets up the payment routes
	// and the payment service. If Stripe calls are made, they would hit the real Stripe API
	// unless Stripe's backend is globally overridden or the service is explicitly given a test client.

	// Placeholder for router setup. In a real scenario, this would come from your app's main setup logic.
	// We'll manually register payment routes for this example if app.SetupRouter is too complex here.

	// testRouter = gin.Default()
	// apiGroup := testRouter.Group("/api/v1") // Assuming routes are under /api/v1
	// payment.RegisterPaymentRoutes(apiGroup, paymentServiceForTest, loggerForTest, cfg, authMiddlewareForTest)

	// The above manual setup is complex. Ideally, a test entry point for the app is available.
	// For now, these tests will be structured assuming `testRouter` is correctly initialized
	// by a function that sets up the full app or relevant parts.
	// If `app.SetupRouter` is not suitable, these tests might need to be adapted or marked as skipped.

	// Let's assume a simplified app init for now.
	// This part is CRITICAL and highly dependent on the actual application structure.
	// Without a running app instance or a way to initialize it for tests, these are just templates.

	// For the purpose of this generated code, let's assume `app.SetupTestApp` exists
	// or it's handled by a CI environment.
	// testRouter, _, _ = app.SetupTestApp(cfg) // Fictional function

	// If we cannot set up the full app, we cannot run true integration tests.
	// These tests will be written as if `testRouter` is a fully configured Gin engine.

	// Hacky way for now, assuming we are in `backend/tests` and `main.go` or similar sets up router.

	// Simulating a Stripe webhook requires:

	// Or, you can use `webhook.ConstructEvent` with test data and then manually sign it if you know the process,
	// but it's easier to use Stripe's provided tools or pre-signed events for testing.
	// For this test, we'll use a placeholder signature and payload.

	// This test will likely fail without a valid signature that matches the payload and webhook secret
	// configured in the application. The payment service's HandleWebhook calls `webhook.ConstructEvent`
	// which will verify this.

	samplePayload := `{"id": "evt_testwh_integ", "type": "payment_intent.succeeded", "data": {"object": {"id": "pi_integ_test", "metadata": {"order_id": "order_integ_webhook"}}}}`

	// Generating a valid signature outside of Stripe's systems is complex.
	// For true integration tests, you might:
	// - Use Stripe CLI to send a test webhook to a running instance of your app.
	// - Have a pre-recorded valid payload and signature for a known test secret.
	// - Mock the `webhook.ConstructEvent` call if this is more of a "handler integration"
	//   than a "full Stripe webhook verification integration". (This would make it less of an integration test).

	// Placeholder: in a real test, get this from Stripe CLI or pre-generate.
	// The webhook secret must match what the running application is configured with.
	// webhookSecret := testConfig.Stripe.WebhookSecret

	// If signature verification is active and correct, this will likely be a 400 Bad Request.
	// If the webhook handler's logic for signature verification is bypassed/mocked for the test,
	// then you'd expect 200 OK if the event type is processed.
	// Given `webhook.ConstructEvent` is called, expect 400 if signature is invalid.
	assert.Equal(t, http.StatusBadRequest, rr.Code, "Response code should be 400 for invalid signature")

	// TODO: Add tests for:
	// - Successfully processing a known valid event (requires valid signature).
	// - Other event types and their effects (e.g., payment_intent.payment_failed).
	// - Malformed payload (should also result in an error, likely 400 or 500).
}


// Note: Proper integration testing for Stripe webhooks often involves setting up an ngrok tunnel
// or similar to expose your local dev server to Stripe's test webhooks, or using the Stripe CLI
// to forward events to your local endpoint. Automated tests for this can be complex.
// Using `stripe-go/testutil.NewTestServer` can help mock Stripe API responses but doesn't directly
// help with incoming webhook *verification* unless you also mock `webhook.ConstructEvent` to trust
// events from this test server (which makes it less of a pure integration test for webhooks).
//
// For `CreatePaymentIntent`, if the payment service is using the default Stripe backend, these tests
// will hit the actual Stripe API (in test mode if test keys are used). Ensure your test environment
// is configured with Stripe test API keys.
// `STRIPE_API_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` should be available as env vars or in config for tests.
// The `config.LoadConfig` should pick these up if your config setup supports it.
// Remember to never use live keys in tests.
//
// The placeholder `app.SetupRouter` or `app.SetupTestApp` is crucial. Without it, these tests are templates.
// It needs to handle:
// - Config loading (done in TestMain example).
// - Database connection (preferably to a test database).
// - Service initializations (like PaymentService, with Stripe keys).
// - Router setup with all middlewares and routes.
//
// If stripe.DefaultBackend was overridden for a test server, it should be reset after tests:
// defer stripe.SetBackend(stripe.APIBackend, nil) // Or whatever the original was.
//
// One common pattern for integration tests is to build and run the application binary
// as a separate process and then send HTTP requests to it. This is a "black-box" approach.
// The current "white-box" (in-process) integration test style is also common and often faster.
//
// The io.Reader for performRequest body should be `bytes.NewBuffer` for JSON.
// The testutil.NewTestServer() from stripe-go is for mocking outgoing API calls from your app to Stripe,
// not for simulating incoming webhooks with signature verification.
//
// For TestMain, it's better to run m.Run() and then os.Exit() with the result.
// `code := m.Run()`
// `os.Exit(code)`
